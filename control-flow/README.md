# Python Control Flow & Loops  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project explains how decisions and repetitions work in Python. It shows how to control what happens in a program, when it happens, and how many times it should happen.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s Covered  

### âœ… Control Flow & Conditionals  
- What control flow is and why it matters in programming.  
- How to use **if, else, and elif** to make choices in code.  
- Simple examples showing how decisions are made in Python.  

### âœ… Match Case (Python 3.10 and above)  
- An easier way to handle many conditions without writing too many `if/elif` statements.  
- The benefits of using **Match Case**.  
- How to write Match Case properly with examples.  
- Tips for writing cleaner and more efficient code.  

### âœ… Loops  
- The purpose of loops and the different types in Python.  
- How to use **for loops** to go through items in lists, strings, and other collections.  
- Examples of for loops with different kinds of data.  
- What **while loops** are and how they differ from for loops.  
- How to use while loops to repeat actions as long as a condition is true.  
- **Nested loops** (loops inside other loops) and how they can be used with patterns or multiple levels of data.
