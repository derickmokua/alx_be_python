# Python Functions, Data Structures, and Modules

## 🌟 Project Aim

This project aims at introducing the **fundamentals of Python programming**, focusing on functions, variable scope, data structures, modules, and external libraries.
The goal is to provide the essential building blocks for creating **organized, reusable, and efficient Python code**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants will be able to:

* **Functions**

  * Define the purpose and importance of functions in programming.
  * Construct functions using `def` and `lambda` with correct syntax.
  * Work with parameters, default values, keyword arguments, and return values.
  * Differentiate between local and global variables.
  * Apply `global` and `nonlocal` keywords to manage scope.

* **Data Structures**

  * Identify and apply Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
  * Select the appropriate data structure for different operations.
  * Perform common operations such as list slicing, dictionary methods, tuple usage, and set operations.

* **Modules and Packages**

  * Explain the concepts of modules and packages.
  * Create and import custom modules.
  * Use standard modules provided by Python.
  * Install and integrate external libraries with `pip` (e.g., `requests`).

* **Variable Scope & Namespaces**

  * Comprehend the **LEGB rule** (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in).
  * Implement best practices for scope management.
  * Differentiate between types of namespaces and describe their lifecycle.

## 🚀 Importance

A solid understanding of these concepts enables the development of programs that are:

* Clean and maintainable
* Efficient and reusable
* Scalable through the use of both standard and external libraries

## 📖 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the files in any Python-compatible editor.
3. Run an example file, for instance:

   ```bash
   python functions/example.py
   ```
4. Install required libraries (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
